I’m a Junior Data Scientist with a focus on statistical learning — including machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning — and data visualization. I’m also exploring emerging areas such as data dignity and applying data science in deliberation systems. Alongside my professional work, I enjoy low‑level programming and am currently building an audio application.
